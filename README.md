The app is as simple as this.
# Width & Height:
Dimensions of pages of the PDF file
# Margins:
Side margins of each page
# "Maintain image aspect ratio":
if not ticked, fits the background image into pages. if ticked, only fits the longer side and leaves equal gaps for the shorter side.
# X/Y-offset:
position of ID numbers with respect to the center

You can import a background image by "Import Image". The center of the BG image should be empty for the ID numbers.
A good example:
![IDnoBG_EFO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c61765d-79fe-4d71-a3f2-e1e8ea41e74f)

Then you have to input start value, stop value (is included in the range), and number of increments.
Then hit "Generate" and you have a PDF of ID NOs.
If you have to generate different intervals, hit "Add interval" and input start & end value for each interval.
