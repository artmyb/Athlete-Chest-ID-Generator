The app is as simple as this.
You can import a background image by "Import Image". The center of the BG image should be empty for the ID numbers.
A good example:
![id_backgorudn](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0df83db-f1c6-4a03-af98-3b9178a39155)
Then you have to input start value, stop value (is included in the range), and number of increments.
Then hit "Generate" and you have a PDF of ID NOs.
